# Time-Traveler's Tightrope

A side-scrolling action/survival game where you balance on a tightrope across the fabric of time, dodging era-specific obstacles while the world shifts around you.

## Game Concept

In "Time-Traveler's Tightrope," you play as a daring time traveler balancing on a tightrope that stretches across the fabric of history. The rope is your lifeline, wobbling under your weight as you navigate through dynamically shifting erasâ€”each with its own distinct challenges and aesthetic.

One moment you're dodging a pterodactyl's swoop in the Jurassic period, the next you're leaping over a futuristic drone's laser in a neon-lit cyberworld. The goal is to survive as long as possible, racking up points by crossing time zones and avoiding era-specific obstacles.

## How to Play

- **Controls**: Use the **Up Arrow** to jump and the **Down Arrow** to duck, avoiding obstacles.
- **Mobile**: Tap the top half of the screen to jump, bottom half to duck.
- **Scoring**: Earn 1 point for each obstacle avoided, with a bonus 5 points for surviving a full time shift.
- **Game Over**: Fall off the rope or collide with an obstacle to end the game. Press Enter or click/tap to restart.

## Features

- **Dynamic Era Shifts**: Every 5-10 seconds, the time period changes, bringing new obstacles and visuals.
- **Tightrope Physics**: The rope sways with sinusoidal motion, adding challenge to your jumps and ducks.
- **Era-Specific Obstacles**: Each time period has unique hazards to avoid:
  - **Jurassic Era**: Pterodactyls swoop from above, vines hang low.
  - **Medieval Era**: Arrows shoot from the side, castle turrets loom overhead.
  - **Cyberpunk Era**: Drones fire lasers from above, electric barriers spark below.
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
